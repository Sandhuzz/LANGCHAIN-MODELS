LLMs. Chat Models. Embeddings. One Framework.

This repository explores LangChain Models, the core interfaces that power every AI workflow in LangChain. Models provide a unified way to interact with large language models (LLMs), chat-based models, and embedding models, making it easier to build applications that understand and generate language.

# 🌟 What Are Models in LangChain?

In LangChain, a Model is a standardized interface to call different types of AI models.

🧠 LLMs → Generate text from prompts

💬 Chat Models → Multi-turn conversational AI

🔎 Embedding Models → Convert text into numerical vectors for search, clustering, and RAG

# ✨ Why Use LangChain Models?

🔗 Unified Interface → Call any model with the same API

⚡ Flexibility → Switch between OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, etc. with minimal changes

🎯 Specialized Types → Separate abstractions for LLMs, chats, and embeddings
